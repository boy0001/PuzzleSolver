# Overview
This project features very efficient implementations of common algorithms for solving the N*M Puzzle (or 15-Puzzle, N-Puzzle etc). Written in Java, which is an awesome language.

## Algorithms:
 - Breadth First Search (BFS)
 - Depth First Search (DFS)
 - Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)
 - A* Search (AS)
 - Iterative Depth First Search (CUS1)
 - Simulated Annealing (CUS2)
 
## Features
 - Random puzzle generation (dimensions, shuffles)
 - Algorithm Testing and Benchmarking
 - Supports any dimensions
 - It's fast :p
